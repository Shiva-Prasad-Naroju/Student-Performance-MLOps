# 🎯 End to End Student Performance Indicator ML project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and predicts student performance in Maths based on socio-economic and academic factors using ML techniques.

## 🔄 Project Life Cycle
1. 📌 Understanding the Problem
2. 📊 Data Collection & Checks
3. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. 🛠 Data Pre-Processing
5. 🤖 Model Training
6. 🏆 Choosing the Best Model

## ❓ Problem Statement
Understanding how student performance (test scores) is influenced by:
- 🧑‍🎓 Gender
- 🌍 Ethnicity
- 🎓 Parental Education
- 🍽 Lunch Type
- 📚 Test Prep Course

## 📂 Dataset Features
- **Gender, Ethnicity, Parental Education, Lunch, Test Prep** (Categorical)
- **Math, Reading, Writing Scores** (Numerical)

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Checks** – Handling missing values, duplicates, outliers
2️⃣ **EDA** – Visualizing trends & correlations
3️⃣ **Data Pre-Processing** – Encoding, scaling, splitting data
4️⃣ **Model Training** – Trying different ML models
5️⃣ **Best Model Selection** – Comparing based on evaluation metrics

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- 📓 Jupyter Notebook
- 🤖 ML Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- 
## 🎯 Expected Outcomes
- Key insights on factors affecting student performance
- Accurate predictive model deployment
